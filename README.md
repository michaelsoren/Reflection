This is my project! I think everything is fine and I have no bugs I know of.
I think all the requirements for the project is complete.

Things that are not implemented are all in the settings menu and have a popup
associated with them, telling you they were not attempted in this version of
the app.

How to test: Should be as easy as downloading, then registering. 
There is no web back end yet for authentication, so just remember what
you made your username and password. If you forget, you can always just
reregister (the screens are there for the UI, not for real functionality yet).

Data is persisted in documents/on iCloud, since my app will be iOS only for the time being.

I did not use any third party frameworks.
